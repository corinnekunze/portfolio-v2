					<p class="font--white margin-top-sm">I like building things and solving problems. Some may describe me as an accomplished Front-end Developer but I tend to stray from that role when curiousity strikes. That includes tackling code on the back-end as well as being an integral part of user experience or visual designs. I am experienced with building large scale, complex applications in frameworks such as Ruby on Rails, Ember.js, and BackboneJS.

					<p class="margin-top-sm font--white">I am driven to build great experiences whilst writing code with an ethos of code legibility
and simplicity. I live and work out of Portland, Oregon.</p>
