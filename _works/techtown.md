paragraph_1: The TechTown Diversity Survey is a project supported by the Portland Development Commission (PDC). This survey is the result of 23 tech companies, located in Portland, Oregon, who have taken the survey and shared their results as part of a <a href="https://jared-wiener.squarespace.com/diversity-letter" target="_blank" class="link--aqua effect--underline">pledge</a> to create a more diverse industry. The goal for the web project was to quickly put together a web site featuring the statistics using interactive charts.
paragraph_2: This wasn't <a href="http://rails-hosting.com/2016/index.html" target="_blank" class="link--aqua effect--underline">my first time</a> working with charts and a large set of data to bring from a CSV to code. Learning from my past projects, I decided to write a Ruby program to parse the CSV file from the survey and collect users based on their selections throughout the survey. From there, the next steps were to take the collected data and generate the charts by formatting the data as Chartist.js was expecting it. Want to see more code for this project?
