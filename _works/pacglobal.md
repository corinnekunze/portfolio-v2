paragraph_1: Pac Global is an insurance brokerage company that had a need for a new workflow for insurance claims when items get damaged or lost in transit. Pac Global had been a partner of Planet Argon for many years, we had been managing their Ruby on Rails application. What started out as a single feature request, turned into a large new section of the existing application which created a new workflow for being able to handle their insurance claims through an automated process. We were able to deliver a robust workflow on a rigorous timeline so that Pac Global's customers could begin using it as soon as possible.
paragraph_2: I stepped into the role as development lead alongside a team of two dedicated back-end developers. Starting this project, we knew using their existing front-end tools were not going to cut it. We decided to move forward with installing React into the existing Rails application (<a href="https://blog.codeship.com/integrating-react-in-a-6-year-old-rails-app/" class="link--aqua effect--underline" target="_blank">read more about this</a>) and were really pleased with our decision to do so. The most complicated parts of this application lied in the existing Pac Global Rails architecture and being able to integrate with 3rd party services their customers were using for itemizing an inventory.
