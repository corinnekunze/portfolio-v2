paragraph_1: Pac Global is an insurance brokerage company that had a need for a new workflow for their customers to create claims when items get damaged or lost in transit. What started out as a single feature request, turned into a feature rich new workflow for being able to handle their claims through an automated process. We were able to deliver a robust set of new functionality on a rigorous timeline so that Pac Global's customers could begin using it as soon as possible.
paragraph_2: I stepped into the role as development lead alongside a team of two dedicated back-end developers. Starting this project, we knew using their existing front-end tools were not going to cut it. We decided to move forward with installing React into the existing Rails application (<a href="https://blog.codeship.com/integrating-react-in-a-6-year-old-rails-app/" class="link--aqua effect--underline" target="_blank">read more about this</a>) and were really pleased with our decision to do so. One of the most rewarding things about this project is we were able to deliver a robust new application workflow in an existing application, all while improving upon the system they have had in place.
