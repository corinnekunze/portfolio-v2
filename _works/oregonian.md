paragraph_1: The Oregonian Recipe Box was a great project to work on, and it was sorely in need of a redesign. The Oregonian had years of recipe data that they had painstakingly collected. However, users were not drawn to these recipes with no photos, poorly optimized search engine optimization, as well as a dated user interface.
paragraph_2: I lead the Front-end Development efforts while working with the design and back-end development teams. Some of the major accomplishments for this project were putting together a custom CMS quickly, writing recipe schema to provide search engines with recipe data to drive traffic, and integrating a fully responsive user experience for filtering, viewing, and searching for recipes.
