paragraph_1: Screaming Circuits is a company that supplies users with a way to order their circuit boards online. The new Screaming Circuits website was a revision of an older web experience that was growing increasingly out of date. The new site is built from the ground up in Ember.js and provides users with real time cost and shipping estimates.
paragraph_2: I had the privilege of playing a large role in this project as the sole Front-End Developer, which meant I was responsible for building all components, styling, animation, and user interaction.  Emberâ€™s development process is not quite so black and white as other frameworks with front-end/back-end responsibilities and I spent much of my time here managing data flow and state management in the application.
