paragraph_1: The Planet Argon website has been through quite the transformation in the past couple years. It had been quite overdue for a redesign when we initially launched it on Squarespace. The new design allows us to show off our design chops as well as showcase our work. Many members in the Planet Argon team have contributions to the Planet Argon site, but for the most part it has been the focus of the design team.
paragraph_2: After some time using Squarespace, we realized we needed to <a href="http://blog.planetargon.com/entries/why-we-moved-our-site-off-of-squarespace" target="_blank" class="link--aqua effect--underline">say goodbye</a> and we decided to move to an out of the box Ruby on Rails CMS called RefineryCMS. My role throughout the project has always consisted of front-end development but the migration to RefineryCMS allowed me to spend time diving into the back-end to create a usable CMS that can be customized to whatever needs arise in the future.
